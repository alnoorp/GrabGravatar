## FAQ

__What information do I need to make this plugin work?__
Make sure you are capturing the email address for your visitors in the User Id field.

__Why do some of my visitors just display the Gravatar logo instead of a photo?__
Either there is no email address associated with the visitor or they do not have a Gravatar set up at gravatar.com
